# Void Linux bspwm
My new configuration for bspwm on Void Linux

## Information
This was just another config I had laying around. I don't have the complete polybar config anymore, but I tried to recreate it. I sill don't remember where I got the notification script from...

The ```pkg``` script just enables you to run BSD like package commands on Void, but it is still not complete.
